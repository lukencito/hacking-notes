<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Pentest Overview<a href="pentest-overview.html#pentest-overview" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>IT is an integral part of nearly every company. The amount of critical and confidential data stored in IT systems is constantly growing, as is dependence on the uninterrupted functioning of the IT systems in use. Therefore, attacks against corporate networks, disruption of system availability, and other ways of causing significant damage to a company (such as ransomware attacks) are becoming increasingly common. Important company information obtained through security breaches and cyber-attacks may be sold to competitors, leaked on public forums, or used for other nefarious purposes. System failures are deliberately triggered because they are increasingly difficult to counteract.</p>
<p>A <code>Penetration Test</code> (<code>Pentest</code>) is an organized, targeted, and authorized attack attempt to test IT infrastructure and its defenders to determine their susceptibility to IT security vulnerabilities. A pentest uses methods and techniques that real attackers use. As penetration testers, we apply various techniques and analyses to gauge the impact that a particular vulnerability or chain of vulnerabilities may have on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an organization’s IT systems and data.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>A pentest aims to uncover and identify ALL vulnerabilities in the systems under investigation and improve the security for the tested systems.</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Other assessments, such as a <code>red team assessment</code>, may be scenario-based and focus on only the vulnerabilities leveraged to reach a specific end goal (i.e., accessing the CEO’s email inbox or obtaining a flag planted on a critical server).</p>
<div id="risk-management" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Risk Management<a href="pentest-overview.html#risk-management" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In general, it is also a part of <code>risk management</code> for a company. The main goal of IT security risk management is to identify, evaluate, and mitigate any potential risks that could damage the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an organization’s information systems and data and reduce the overall risk to an acceptable level. This includes identifying potential threats, evaluating their risks, and taking the necessary steps to reduce or eliminate them. This is done by implementing the appropriate security controls and policies, including access control, encryption, and other security measures. By taking the time to properly manage the security risks of an organization’s IT systems, it is possible to ensure that the data is kept safe and secure.</p>
<p>However, we cannot eliminate every risk. There’s still the nature of the inherent risk of a security breach that is present even when the organization has taken all reasonable steps to manage the risk. Therefore, some risks will remain. Inherent risk is the level of risk that is present even when the appropriate security controls are in place. Companies can accept, transfer, avoid and mitigate risks in various ways. For example, they can purchase insurance to cover certain risks, such as natural disasters or accidents. By entering into a contract, they can also transfer their risks to another party, such as a third-party service provider. Additionally, they can implement preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of certain risks occurring, and if certain risks do occur, they can put in place processes to minimize their impact. Finally, they can use financial instruments, such as derivatives, to reduce the economic consequences of specific risks. All of these strategies can help companies effectively manage their risks.</p>
<p>During a pentest, we prepare detailed documentation on the steps taken and the results achieved. However, it is the client’s responsibility or the operator of their systems under investigation to rectify the vulnerabilities found. Our role is as trusted advisors to report vulnerabilities, detailed reproduction steps, and provide appropriate remediation recommendations, but we do not go in and apply patches or make code changes, etc. It is important to note that a pentest is not monitoring the IT infrastructure or systems but a momentary snapshot of the security status. A statement to this regard should be reflected in our penetration test report deliverable.</p>
</div>
<div id="vulnerability-assessments" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Vulnerability Assessments<a href="pentest-overview.html#vulnerability-assessments" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><code>Vulnerability analysis</code> is a generic term that can include vulnerability or security assessments and penetration tests. In contrast to a penetration test, vulnerability or security assessments are performed using purely automated tools. Systems are checked against known issues and security vulnerabilities by running scanning tools like <a href="https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus">Nessus</a>, <a href="https://www.qualys.com/apps/vulnerability-management/">Qualys</a>, <a href="https://www.openvas.org/">OpenVAS</a>, and similar. In most cases, these automated checks cannot adapt the attacks to the configurations of the target system. This is why manual testing conducted by an experienced human tester is essential.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a pentest is a mix of automated and manual testing/validation and is performed after extensive, in most cases, manual information gathering. It is individually tailored and adjusted to the system being tested. Planning, execution, and selection of the tools used are much more complex in a pentest. Both penetration tests and other security assessments may only be carried out after mutual agreement between the contracting company and the organization that employs the penetration tester. This is because individual tests and activities performed during the pentest could be treated as criminal offenses if the tester does not have explicit written authorization to attack the customer’s systems. The organization commissioning the penetration test may only request testing against its’ own assets. If they are using any third parties to host websites or other infrastructure, they need to gain explicit written approval from these entities in most cases. Companies like Amazon no longer require prior authorization for testing certain services per this <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/">policy</a>, if a company is using AWS to host some or all of their infrastructure. This varies from provider to provider, so it is always best to confirm asset ownership with the client during the scoping phase and check to see if any third parties they use require a written request process before any testing is performed.</p>
<p>A successful pentest requires a considerable amount of organization and preparation. There must be a straightforward process model that we can follow and, at the same time, adapt to the needs of our clients, as every environment we encounter will be different and have its own nuances. In some cases, we may work with clients who have never experienced a pentest before, and we have to be able to explain this process in detail to make sure they have a clear understanding of our planned activities, and we help them scope the assessment accurately.</p>
<p>In principle, employees are not informed about the upcoming penetration tests. However, managers may decide to inform their employees about the tests. This is because employees have a right to know when they have no expectation of privacy.</p>
<p>Because we, as penetration testers, can find personal data, such as names, addresses, salaries, and much more. The best thing we can do to uphold the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/data-protection">Data Protection Act</a> is to keep this information private. Another example would be that we get access to a database with credit card numbers, names, and CVV codes. Accordingly, we recommend that our customers improve and change the passwords as soon as possible and encrypt the data on the database.</p>

<div id="testing-methods" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Testing Methods<a href="pentest-overview.html#testing-methods" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>An essential part of the process is the starting point from which we should perform our pentest. Each pentest can be performed from two different perspectives:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>External</code> or <code>Internal</code></li>
</ul>
<div id="external-penetration-test" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> External Penetration Test<a href="pentest-overview.html#external-penetration-test" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Many pentests are performed from an external perspective or as an anonymous user on the Internet. Most customers want to ensure that they are as protected as possible against attacks on their external network perimeter. We can perform testing from our own host (hopefully using a VPN connection to avoid our ISP blocking us) or from a VPS. Some clients will not care about stealth, while others will request that we proceed as quietly as possible and approach the target systems to avoid being banned by the firewalls and IDS/IPS systems and avoid triggering an alarm. They may ask for a stealthy or “hybrid” approach where we gradually become “noisier” to test their detection capabilities. Ultimately our goal here is to access external-facing hosts, obtain sensitive data, or gain access to the internal network.</p>
</div>
<div id="internal-penetration-test" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Internal Penetration Test<a href="pentest-overview.html#internal-penetration-test" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>In contrast to an external pentest, an internal pentest is when we perform testing from within the corporate network. This stage may be executed after successfully penetrating the corporate network via the external pentest or starting from an assumed breach scenario. Internal pentests may also access isolated systems with no internet access whatsoever, which usually requires our physical presence at the client’s facility.</p>

<div id="types-of-penetration-testing" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Types of Penetration Testing<a href="pentest-overview.html#types-of-penetration-testing" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>No matter how we begin the pentest, the type of pentest plays an important role. This type determines how much information is made available to us. We can narrow down these types to the following:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="5%" />
<col width="94%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Type</strong></th>
<th><strong>Information Provided</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>Blackbox</code></td>
<td><code>Minimal</code>. Only the essential information, such as IP addresses and domains, is provided.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>Greybox</code></td>
<td><code>Extended</code>. In this case, we are provided with additional information, such as specific URLs, hostnames, subnets, and similar.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>Whitebox</code></td>
<td><code>Maximum</code>. Here everything is disclosed to us. This gives us an internal view of the entire structure, which allows us to prepare an attack using internal information. We may be given detailed configurations, admin credentials, web application source code, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>Red-Teaming</code></td>
<td>May include physical testing and social engineering, among other things. Can be combined with any of the above types.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>Purple-Teaming</code></td>
<td>It can be combined with any of the above types. However, it focuses on working closely with the defenders.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The less information we are provided with, the longer and more complex the approach will take. For example, for a blackbox penetration test, we must first get an overview of which servers, hosts, and services are present in the infrastructure, especially if entire networks are tested. This type of recon can take a considerable amount of time, especially if the client has requested a more stealthy approach to testing.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="types-of-testing-environments" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Types of Testing Environments<a href="pentest-overview.html#types-of-testing-environments" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Apart from the test method and the type of test, another consideration is what is to be tested, which can be summarized in the following categories:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="11%" />
<col width="11%" />
<col width="27%" />
<col width="27%" />
<col width="21%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Network</td>
<td>Web App</td>
<td>Mobile</td>
<td>API</td>
<td>Thick Clients</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>IoT</td>
<td>Cloud</td>
<td>Source Code</td>
<td>Physical Security</td>
<td>Employees</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Hosts</td>
<td>Server</td>
<td>Security Policies</td>
<td>Firewalls</td>
<td>IDS/IPS</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It is important to note that these categories can often be mixed. All listed test components may be included depending on the type of test to be performed. Now we’ll shift gears and cover the Penetration Process in-depth to see how each phase is broken down and depends on the previous one.</p>

<div id="laws-and-regulations" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Laws and Regulations<a href="pentest-overview.html#laws-and-regulations" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Each country has specific federal laws which regulate computer-related activities, copyright protection, interception of electronic communications, use and disclosure of protected health information, and collection of personal information from children, respectively.</p>
<p>It is essential to follow these laws to protect individuals from <code>unauthorized access</code> and <code>exploitation of their data</code> and to ensure their privacy. We must be aware of these laws to ensure our research activities are compliant and do not violate any of the provisions of the law. Failure to comply with these laws can result in civil or criminal penalties, making it essential for individuals to familiarize themselves with the law and understand the potential implications of their activities. Furthermore, it is crucial to ensure that research activities adhere to these laws’ requirements to protect individuals’ privacy and guard against the potential misuse of their data. By following these laws and exercising caution when conducting research activities, security researchers can help ensure that individuals’ data is kept secure and their rights are protected. Here is a summary of the related laws and regulations for a few countries and regions:</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-48000-computer-fraud">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a> (<code>CFAA</code>) is a federal law that makes it a criminal offense to access a computer without authorization. It applies to computer-related activities, including hacking, identity theft, and spreading malware. The CFAA has been the focus of much criticism and controversy, with some arguing that its provisions are too far-reaching and could be used to criminalize legitimate security research. In addition, critics have raised the concern that people can interpret the CFAA’s broad definitions of computer-related activities in a manner that could lead to the prosecution of activities that were not intended to be criminal offenses. Furthermore, the CFAA has been criticized for needing more clarity regarding the meaning of specific terms, making it difficult for individuals to understand their rights and responsibilities under the law. For these reasons, it is crucial for individuals to familiarize themselves with the law and to understand the potential implications of their activities.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/house-bill/2281">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a> (<code>DMCA</code>) includes provisions prohibiting circumventing technological measures to protect copyrighted works. This can consist of digital locks, encryption, and authentication protocols, which safeguard software, firmware, and other types of digital content. Security researchers should know the DMCA provisions to ensure their research activities do not violate the law. It is important to remember that circumventing copyright protection measures, even for research or educational activities, can result in civil or criminal penalties. As such, researchers must exercise caution and due diligence to avoid inadvertently running afoul of the DMCA.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/house-bill/4952">Electronic Communications Privacy Act</a> (<code>ECPA</code>) regulates the interception of electronic communications, including those sent over the Internet. This law makes it unlawful to intercept, access, monitor, or store communications without one or both parties consent. Furthermore, the ECPA prohibits using intercepted communications as evidence in a court of law. The ECPA also outlines the responsibilities of service providers, as they are not allowed to divulge the contents of communications to anyone except the sender and the receiver. Therefore, the ECPA protects the privacy of electronic communications and ensures that individuals are not subjected to illegal interception or use of their communications.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/health-insurance-portability-accountability-act-1996">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</a> (<code>HIPAA</code>) governs the use and disclosure of protected health information and includes a set of rules for safeguarding personal health information stored electronically. Researchers should know these requirements and ensure their research activities adhere to HIPAA regulations. This includes taking measures such as encrypting data, keeping detailed data access, and sharing records. Furthermore, research must be conducted by institutional policies and procedures, and the appropriate governance body must approve any changes made. Researchers must also be mindful of the possibility of data breaches and take steps to ensure that any personal health information is kept secure. Failure to comply with HIPAA regulations can result in severe legal and financial penalties, so researchers must ensure that their research activities comply with HIPAA.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-coppa">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act</a> (<code>COPPA</code>) is an important piece of legislation regulating the collection of personal information from children under 13. We must be aware of the provisions of COPPA and take precautions to ensure that our research activities do not violate any of the requirements of the Act. To comply with COPPA, researchers must exercise caution and take special steps to ensure that they are not collecting, using, or disclosing any personal information from children under the age of 13. Failure to comply with COPPA could result in legal action and penalties, so security researchers must familiarize themselves with the Act and comply with its provisions.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span> Pre-Engagement<a href="pentest-overview.html#pre-engagement" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Pre-engagement is the stage of preparation for the actual penetration test. During this stage, many questions are asked, and some contractual agreements are made. The client informs us about what they want to be tested, and we explain in detail how to make the test as efficient as possible.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/90/0-PT-Process-PRE.png" /></p>
<p>The entire pre-engagement process consists of three essential components:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Scoping questionnaire</p></li>
<li><p>Pre-engagement meeting</p></li>
<li><p>Kick-off meeting</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Before any of these can be discussed in detail, a <code>Non-Disclosure Agreement</code> (<code>NDA</code>) must be signed by all parties. There are several types of NDAs:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Type</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>Unilateral NDA</code></td>
<td>This type of NDA obligates only one party to maintain confidentiality and allows the other party to share the information received with third parties.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>Bilateral NDA</code></td>
<td>In this type, both parties are obligated to keep the resulting and acquired information confidential. This is the most common type of NDA that protects the work of penetration testers.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>Multilateral NDA</code></td>
<td>Multilateral NDA is a commitment to confidentiality by more than two parties. If we conduct a penetration test for a cooperative network, all parties responsible and involved must sign this document.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Exceptions can also be made in urgent cases, where we jump into the kick-off meeting, which can also occur via an online conference. It is essential to know <code>who in the company is permitted</code> to contract us for a penetration test. Because we cannot accept such an order from everyone. Imagine, for example, that a company employee hires us with the pretext of checking the corporate network’s security. However, after we finished the assessment, it turned out that this employee wanted to harm their own company and had no authorization to have the company tested. This would put us in a critical situation from a legal point of view.</p>
<p>Below is a sample (not exhaustive) list of company members who may be authorized to hire us for penetration testing. This can vary from company to company, with larger organizations not involving the C-level staff directly and the responsibility falling on IT, Audit, or IT Security senior management or the like.</p>

<p>It is vital to determine early on in the process who has signatory authority for the contract, Rules of Engagement documents, and who will be the primary and secondary points of contact, technical support, and contact for escalating any issues.</p>
<p>This stage also requires the preparation of several documents before a penetration test can be conducted that must be signed by our client and us so that the declaration of consent can also be presented in written form if required. Otherwise the penetration test could breach the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/contents">Computer Misuse Act</a>. These documents include, but are not limited to:</p>

<p>Note: Our client may provide a separate scoping document listing in-scope IP addresses/ranges/URLs and any necessary credentials but this information should also be documented as an appendix in the RoE document.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong></p>
<p>These documents should be reviewed and adapted by a lawyer after they have been prepared.</p>

<div id="scoping-questionnaire" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.7.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.7.1</span> Scoping Questionnaire<a href="pentest-overview.html#scoping-questionnaire" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>After initial contact is made with the client, we typically send them a <code>Scoping Questionnaire</code> to better understand the services they are seeking. This scoping questionnaire should clearly explain our services and may typically ask them to choose one or more from the following list:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>☐ Internal Vulnerability Assessment</td>
<td>☐ External Vulnerability Assessment</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">

<td>☐ External Penetration Test</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>☐ Wireless Security Assessment</td>
<td>☐ Application Security Assessment</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>☐ Physical Security Assessment</td>
<td>☐ Social Engineering Assessment</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>☐ Red Team Assessment</td>
<td>☐ Web Application Security Assessment</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Under each of these, the questionnaire should allow the client to be more specific about the required assessment. Do they need a web application or mobile application assessment? Secure code review? Should the Internal Penetration Test be black box and semi-evasive? Do they want just a phishing assessment as part of the Social Engineering Assessment or also vishing calls? This is our chance to explain the depth and breadth of our services, ensure that we understand our client’s needs and expectations, and ensure that we can adequately deliver the assessment they require.</p>
<p>Aside from the assessment type, client name, address, and key personnel contact information, some other critical pieces of information include:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>

<tr class="odd">
<td>How many expected live hosts?</td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>For a phishing assessment, how many users will be targeted? Will the client provide a list, or we will be required to gather this list via OSINT?</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>If the client is requesting a Physical Assessment, how many locations? If multiple sites are in-scope, are they geographically dispersed?</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>What is the objective of the Red Team Assessment? Are any activities (such as phishing or physical security attacks) out of scope?</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Is a separate Active Directory Security Assessment desired?</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Will network testing be conducted from an anonymous user on the network or a standard domain user?</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Do we need to bypass Network Access Control (NAC)?</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Finally, we will want to ask about information disclosure and evasiveness (if applicable to the assessment type):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is the Penetration Test black box (no information provided), grey box (only IP address/CIDR ranges/URLs provided), white box (detailed information provided)</p></li>
<li><p>Would they like us to test from a non-evasive, hybrid-evasive (start quiet and gradually become “louder” to assess at what level the client’s security personnel detect our activities), or fully evasive.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This information will help us ensure we assign the right resources and deliver the engagement based on the client’s expectations. This information is also necessary for providing an accurate proposal with a project timeline (for example, a Vulnerability Assessment will take considerably less time than a Red Team Assessment) and cost (an External Penetration Test against 10 IPs will cost significantly less than an Internal Penetration Test with 30 /24 networks in-scope).</p>
<p>Based on the information we received from the scoping questionnaire, we create an overview and summarize all information in the <code>Scoping Document</code>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.7.2</span> Pre-Engagement Meeting<a href="pentest-overview.html#pre-engagement-meeting" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Once we have an initial idea of the client’s project requirements, we can move on to the <code>pre-engagement meeting</code>. This meeting discusses all relevant and essential components with the customer before the penetration test, explaining them to our customer. The information we gather during this phase, along with the data collected from the scoping questionnaire, will serve as inputs to the <code>Penetration Testing Proposal</code>, also known as the <code>Contract</code> or <code>Scope of Work</code> (<code>SoW</code>). We can think of the whole process as a visit to the doctor to inform ourselves regarding the planned examinations. This phase typically occurs via e-mail and during an online conference call or in-person meeting.</p>
<p>Note: We may encounter clients during our career that are undergoing their first ever penetration test, or the direct client PoC is not familiar with the process. It is not uncommon to use part of the pre-engagement meeting to review the scoping questionnaire either in part or step-by-step.</p>

<td><code>☐ Third Parties</code></td>
<td>For the third parties, it must be determined via which third-party providers our customer obtains services. These can be cloud providers, ISPs, and other hosting providers. Our client must obtain written consent from these providers describing that they agree and are aware that certain parts of their service will be subject to a simulated hacking attack. It is also highly advisable to require the contractor to forward the third-party permission sent to us so that we have actual confirmation that this permission has indeed been obtained.</td>

<p>The most crucial element of this meeting is the detailed presentation of the penetration test to our client and its focus. As we already know, each piece of infrastructure is unique for the most part, and each client has particular preferences on which they place the most importance. Finding out these priorities is an essential part of this meeting.</p>
<p>We can think of it as ordering in a restaurant. If we want a medium-rare steak and the chef gives us a well-done steak because he believes it is better, it will not be what we were hoping for. Therefore, we should prioritize our client’s wishes and serve the steak as they ordered.</p>
<p>Based on the <code>Contract Checklist</code> and the input information shared in scoping, the <code>Penetration Testing Proposal</code> (<code>Contract</code>) and the associated <code>Rules of Engagement</code> (<code>RoE</code>) are created.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.7.3</span> Kick-Off Meeting<a href="pentest-overview.html#kick-off-meeting" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The <code>kick-off meeting</code> usually occurs at a scheduled time and in-person after signing all contractual documents. This meeting usually includes client POC(s) (from Internal Audit, Information Security, IT, Governance &amp; Risk, etc., depending on the client), client technical support staff (developers, sysadmins, network engineers, etc.), and the penetration testing team (someone in a management role (such as the Practice Lead), the actual penetration tester(s), and sometimes a Project Manager or even the Sales Account Executive or similar). We will go over the nature of the penetration test and how it will take place. Usually, there is no Denial of Service (DoS) testing. We also explain that if a critical vulnerability is identified, penetration testing activities will be paused, a vulnerability notification report will be generated, and the emergency contacts will be contacted. Typically these are only generated during External Penetration Tests for critical flaws such as unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE), SQL injection, or another flaw that leads to sensitive data disclosure. The purpose of this notification is to allow the client to assess the risk internally and determine if the issue warrants an emergency fix. We would typically only stop an Internal Penetration Test and alert the client if a system becomes unresponsive, we find evidence of illegal activity (such as illegal content on a file share) or the presence of an external threat actor in the network or a prior breach.</p>
<p>We must also inform our customers about potential risks during a penetration test. For example, we should mention that a penetration test can leave many <code>log entries and alarms</code> in their security applications. In addition, if brute forcing or any similar attack is used, it is also worth mentioning that we may accidentally <code>lock some users</code> found during the penetration test. We also must inform our customers that they must contact us immediately if the penetration test performed <code>negatively impacts their network</code>.</p>
<p>Explaining the penetration testing process gives everyone involved a clear idea of our entire process. This demonstrates our professional approach and convinces our questioners that we know what we are doing. Because apart from the technical staff, CTO, and CISO, it will sound like a certain kind of magic that is very difficult for non-technical professionals to understand. So we must be mindful of our audience and target the most technically inexperienced questioner so our approach can be followed by everyone we talk to.</p>
<p>All points related to testing need to be discussed and clarified. It is crucial to respond precisely to the wishes and expectations of the customer/client. Every company structure and network is different and requires an adapted approach. Each client has different goals, and we should adjust our testing to their wishes. We can typically see how experienced our clients are in undergoing penetration tests early in the call, so we may have to shift our focus to explain things in more detail and be prepared to field more questions, or the kickoff call may be very quick and straightforward.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.7.4</span> Contractors Agreement<a href="pentest-overview.html#contractors-agreement" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>If the penetration test also includes physical testing, then an additional contractor’s agreement is required. Since it is not only a virtual environment but also a physical intrusion, completely different laws apply here. It is also possible that many of the employees have not been informed about the test. Suppose we encounter employees with a very high-security awareness during the physical attack and social engineering attempts, and we get caught. In that case, the employees will, in most cases, contact the police. This additional <code>contractor's agreement</code> is our “<code>get out of jail free card</code>” in this case.</p>

<p>After all the above points have been worked through, and we have the necessary information, we plan our approach and prepare everything. We will find that the penetration test results are still unknown, but we can prepare our VMs, VPS, and other tools/systems for all scenarios and situations. More information and how to prepare these systems can be found in the <a href="https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/87">Setting Up</a> module.</p>
